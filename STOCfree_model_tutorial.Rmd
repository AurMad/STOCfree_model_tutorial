# The STOCfree R package

---
## The `STOCfree` R package

- Set of functions for the prediction of herd-level probabilities of infection from longitudinal surveillance data

- Inference and prediction performed using either Stan or JAGS, called from R

- Package hosted on Github: 

.center[https://github.com/AurMad/STOCfree]

 - This page also contains the package documentation

---
## Installing Stan

- The `CmdStan` implementation is used through the `CmdStanR` interface

- To install `CmdStan` and `CmdStanR`, follow the instructions on this page: 

.center[https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/]

- Also requires installing the `posterior` package to process Stan results

.center[https://github.com/stan-dev/posterior]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("posterior", 
                 pos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", 
                 getOption("repos")))
```

---
## Installing JAGS

- Install JAGS version 4.3.

.center[https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/]

- Install the `runjags` package as the interface between `R` and `JAGS`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("runjags")
```

---
## Installing the `STOCfree` package

- Installed from Github using the `install_github()` function from the `remotes` (or `devtools`) package

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("AurMad/STOCfree")
```

---
## Setup

- For this tutorial, you need to attach the `STOCfree` package as well as the packages from the `tidyverse` and `ggplot2`

```{r attaching packages}
library(STOCfree)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

---
## Setup

- To demonstrate how to use the package, we will use the `herdBTM` dataset
```{r herdBTM dataset}
herdBTM
```

# Steps of the analysis

---
## Steps of the analysis
 
Modelling will usually consist in the following steps:

1. Format the test data for analysis
1. Define the prior distributions for test characteristics
1. Define the prior distributions for the model parameters related to status dynamics
1. Adding risk factors
1. Define the prior distributions for the association between risk factors and probability of becoming infected (status positive)
1. Run the STOC free model
1. Analyse the model outputs

# Formatting the test data for analysis

---
## Formatting the test data for analysis

- **Aim**: create an object that can be used as input by the functions for estimation and prediction from surveillance test data

- **Input**: the input dataset must be a table containing one row per herd/test date

- Looking at the `herdBTM` dataset:
 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
herdBTM[1:3, 1:5]
```
- Columns:
 - `Farm`: herd id
 - `DateOfTest`: date of test formatted as *YYYY-mm-dd*
 - `ODR`: test result as a continuous value
 - `Test`: name of the test used
 - `TestResult`: test result as a binary variable

---
## The `STOCfree_data()` function

- The `STOCfree_data()` function takes a table containing surveillance test data as input and creates an object that is used by the STOC free model

---
## The `STOCfree_data()` function

- The main arguments of the function are:

 - `test_data`: name of the table (data.frame or tibble) containing the surveillance test data
 - `test_herd_col`: name of the column of test_data containing the herd id
 - `test_date_col`: name of the column containing the date of test formatted as YYYY-mm-dd
 - `test_res_col`: name of the column containing test results as a binary variable. This column should only contain 0 and 1 values
 - `test_name_col`: name of the test used. If omitted, only one test is considered
 - `status_dynamics_scale`: if `proba`, infection dynamics is modelled on the probability scale with priors defined with Beta distributions. If `logit`, infection dynamics is modelled on the logit scale with priors defined with normal distributions.

---
## The `STOCfree_data()` function

- Example using the `herdBTM` dataset:

```{r}
sfd <- STOCfree_data(test_data = herdBTM,
                     test_herd_col = "Farm",
                     test_date_col = "DateOfTest",
                     test_res_col = "TestResult",
                     test_name_col = "Test",
                     test_level = "herd",
                     status_dynamics_scale = "logit")
```

# Model priors

---
## Model priors

- Prior distributions need to be provided for
 - Test characteristics
 - Latent status dynamics
 - Risk factors of new infection when included
 
- The prior distributions need to be added to the STOCfree_data object created above

---
## Prior distributions for test chararcteristics

- Priors for test characteristics are defined using Beta distributions

- Suitable distribution parameters can be identified using the `shiny_beta()` from the `betadistapp` package. The function is a shiny app that computes the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters of a Beta distribution using sliding scales to plot different distribution shapes.

- installing the package
```{r installs the betadistapp package, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("AurMad/betadistapp")
```

- attaching the package
 
```{r attaches the betadistapp package, eval = FALSE}
library(betadistapp)
```
 
- launching the app
```{r launches the shiny_beta function, eval = FALSE}
shiny_beta()
```

---
## Prior distributions for test chararcteristics

- The current values for the prior distribution parameters can be visualised

```{r}
show_tests(sfd)
```

---
## Prior distributions for test chararcteristics

- These values are changed as follows:

```{r}
sfd <- set_priors_tests(sfd,
                 test = "BTM_ODR",
                 Se_a = 5000,
                 Se_b = 260,
                 Sp_a = 20,
                 Sp_b = 2)

sfd <- set_priors_tests(sfd,
                 test = "confirm",
                 Se_a = 20,
                 Se_b = 2,
                 Sp_a = 10000,
                 Sp_b = 1)
```

---
## Prior distributions for test chararcteristics

- The prior distributions for test characteristics can be plotted:

```{r, out.height = 450}
plot_priors_tests(sfd)
```

---
## Prior distributions for status dynamics

- The current values for the parameters of the prior distributions can be plotted:

```{r}
show_priors_status_dyn(sfd)
```

- The message at the bottom of the output can be used to set the priors

---
## Prior distributions for status dynamics

- The required parameters depend on the value used for the `status_dynamics_scale` argument in the call to `STOCfree_data()`

- Here means and standard deviations of normal distributions on the logit scale
 

---
## Prior distributions for status dynamics

- Suitable distribution parameters can be identified using the `shiny_logitnorm()` from the `logitnormdistapp` package. The function is a shiny app that computes the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution on the logit scale using sliding scales to plot different distribution shapes.

- installing the package
```{r installs the logitnormdistapp package, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("AurMad/logitnormdistapp")
```

- attaching the package
 
```{r attaches the logitnormdistapp package, eval = FALSE}
library(logitnormdistapp)
```
 
- launching the app
```{r launches the shiny_logitnorm function, eval = FALSE}
shiny_logitnorm()
```
---
## Prior distributions for status dynamics

- Setting the priors

```{r setting priors for status dynamics}
sfd <- set_priors_status_dyn(sfd, 
                              logit_pi1_mean = -1, 
                              logit_pi1_sd = .5, 
                              logit_tau1_mean = -3, 
                              logit_tau1_sd = 1, 
                              logit_tau2_mean = 2.2, 
                              logit_tau2_sd = .1)
```

---
## Prior distributions for status dynamics

- The prior distributions for test characteristics can be plotted:

```{r plot priors status dynamics, out.height = 450}
plot_priors_status_dyn(sfd)
```

# Adding risk factors


---
## Adding risk factors to the model

- Risk factors can be added to the model when available
 - This step can be skipped
 - It is better to run the model without risk factors first
 - When risk factors are added, the priors for tau1 disappear
 
- Risk factors can be specified with a lag (in months) between the date where the risk factor is recorded and the date of new new infection

- When risk factors are added, priors for coefficients of the logistic regression need to be provided

---
## Adding risk factors to the model

- We will use the intro dataset from the `STOCfree` package as an example
 - Contains the same herds as `herdBTM`
 - The risk factor in the data is the number of cattle introduced

```{r intro dataset}
intro
```

---
## Adding risk factors to the model

- Risk factors need to be added to objects created by the the `STOCfree_data()` function

- The `sf_add_risk_factor()` function is used.

```{r adding risk factors to the STOC free data object}
sfd <- sf_add_risk_factor(
  sfd = sfd,
  risk_factor_data = intro,
  risk_herd_col = "Farm",
  risk_date_col = "dateIntr",
  risk_factor_col = "nAnim",
  risk_factor_type = "continuous",
  lag1 = 8,
  lag2 = 8,
  FUN = sum)
```

- If there are several risk factors, this step must be repeated with each risk factor

---
## Prior distributions for risk factors of new infection

- These priors are for the coefficients of a logistic regression modelling the association between risk factors and the probability of new infection

- Priors distributions are required for
 - the model intercept
 - each of the risk factor

---
## Prior distributions for risk factors of new infection

- The list of risk factors can be displayed

```{r showing list of risk factors}
show_rf(sfd)
```

- Setting the parameters of the distributions for the different risk factors

```{r setting priors for risk factors}
sfd <- set_priors_rf(sfd,
                   risk_factor = "Intercept",
                   mean = -3, sd = 1)


sfd <- set_priors_rf(sfd,
                   risk_factor = "nAnim_8_8",
                   mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

# Running the STOC free model

---
## Running the STOC free model

- There are 2 versions of the model included in the package:
 - Stan version with the `STOCfree_Stan()` function
 - JAGS version with the `STOCfree_JAGS()` function
 
- The arguments of both functions are the same with a few exceptions

---
## Stan version

- Here is an example of how to call the function using the example described above

```{r Stan model, eval = FALSE}
sfm_stan <- STOCfree_Stan(sfd,
                      n_chains = 3,
                      n_iter = 1000,
                      n_thin = 1,
                      out_path = "STOCfree_Stan")
```

---
## Stan version

- The function's arguments are:
 - `STOCfree_data`: an object created with the `STOCfree_data()` function
 - `n_chains`: number of chains to run
 - `n_iter`: number of iterations
 - `n_thin`: a value of 1 is usually good as the autocorrelation is limited with the Stan model
 - `n_warmup`: number of initial iterations to discard. The default is 1000.
 - `save_output`: should the model outputs be saved as csv files. The default (recommended) is TRUE
 - `out_path`: where should the model output be saved. The default is `STOCfree_files`. Should be modified if several models are run.


---
## JAGS version

- Here is an example of how to call the function using the example described above

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sfm_jags <- STOCfree_JAGS(sfd,
                      n_chains = 3,
                      n_burnin = 100,
                      n_iter = 100,
                      n_thin = 1,
                      out_path = "STOCfree_JAGS")
```

---
## JAGS version

- The function's arguments are:
 - `STOCfree_data`: an object created with the `STOCfree_data()` function
 - `n_chains`: number of chains to run
 - `n_iter`: number of iterations
 - `n_thin`: the autocorrelation can be important with the JAGS model.
 - `n_burnin`: number of initial iterations to discard.
 - `save_output`: should the model outputs be saved as csv files. The default (recommended) is TRUE
 - `out_path`: where should the model output be saved. The default is `STOCfree_files`. Should be modified if several models are run.

# Analysing the model outputs

---
## Analysing the model outputs

- The model generates 2 types of outputs:
 - estimated model parameters
 - predicted probabilities of being status positive on the last month of surveillance data
 
- Additionally, the JAGS model produces estimates of monthly prevalences for all the months in the test data

- These data can be: 
 - extracted from the objects generated by the model
 - loaded from the disk when the `save_output` argument has been set to TRUE when calling the model


---
## Parameter estimates

- Extraction of the MCMC samples from the model output:

```{r extracting MCMC draws from model, eval = FALSE}
param <- extract_STOCfree_param(sfm_stan)
